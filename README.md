#Skill Swap
It is a Project in which we have made a website where users can sign up and add what skills they possess and what they wish to learn and with that they can search them using filters based on skills they wish to learn.
    
    We thought about the Project and we think it's not ideal to just be able to add any skills to your profile without verification, we think it would be more safer and productive for anyone to upload a skill they would need to take a simple test on the basics of that skill with little time so they cannot search it up but still ample for them to answer.
   
    And we think it will be better to add some default skills in the database such as python so they don't need to wait if they want to add it to their profile they can just simply take a test and add it but if it's a skill not in database and they want to add it they need to request it and an admin can check and give the permission for it this way we can remove the part where an admin needs to monitor and remove skills which are inappropriate, and instead we can train an simple ai for it to do this task which will be easier as well as efficient.
